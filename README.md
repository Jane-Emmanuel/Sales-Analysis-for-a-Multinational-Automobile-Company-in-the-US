### Data Collection
Sales data was obtained from a central transaction database of the company representing orders placed by customers across multiple countries. Each record included attributes such as:

* `Customer ID`
* `OrderNo`
* `OrderQuantity`
* `CostPrice_usd`
* `SellingPrice_usd`
* `OrderDate`
* `CustomerName`
* `CustomerCity`
* `CustomerState`
* `CustomerCountry`
* `ProductCategory`
* `ProductColor`
* `Model`

```python
# solution
import pandas as pd
bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/USER/Downloads/bikes.csv")
bikes_df.head()
```

### Data Inspection and Cleaning
- **1. Check for Missing values**:
```python
# solution
bikes_df.isna().any()
```
# counting the number of missing values 
```python
total_number_of_missing_values_by_column = bikes_df.isna().sum()
total_number_of_missing_values_by_column
```
# Total number of the datasets/datapoints
```python
len(bikes_df)
```

# visualizing the total number of misssing values
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
total_number_of_missing_values_by_column.plot(kind= "bar")
# to show plot
plt.show()
```

- **2.Handling Missing values**:
```python
# solution 
# finding out the most popula value in the product color columns (column containing text)

bikes_df["ProductColor"].mode()

# filling up the missing values with the value "black"
bikes_df = bikes_df.fillna("Black")

bikes_df
```

# to verify that there are no more missing values on our dataset 
```python
bikes_df.isna().any()
```

- **3. Check for  Duplicates**:
# solution

# counting the total number of our datapoint
```python
len(bikes_df)
```

### Data Modification
# generating some core metrics which were NOT provided from the dataset, which would be required for the purpose of the data analysis
```python
# solution 

# (1) TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# (2) SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# (3) Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)


bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"]  - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


# Displaying the result

bikes_df.head()
```

### Data Filtering
# Filtering out the required datasat (a subset data) for the analysis

# Total Profits generated by States in the US
```python
# logical condition 1
is_usa = bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"

# logical condition 2
is_bike = bikes_df["ProductCategory"] == "Bikes"

bikes_data_usa = bikes_df[  (is_usa) &  (is_bike)  ]

bikes_data_usa
```

### Data Aggregation

# Computing/ Aggregating the sales data to show The Total Profits By States 
```python
# solution 
total_profits_by_states_bikes_USA = bikes_data_usa.groupby(["CustomerState", "CustomerCountry"])["Profit"].sum().reset_index()

total_profits_by_states_bikes_USA
```

### Data Sorting/ Data Ranking
# To Determine the Most Important Metric: Top 5 States by Total profits
```python
# solution 

top_5_most_profitable_states = total_profits_by_states_bikes_USA.sort_values("Profit", ascending = False).head()

top_5_most_profitable_states
```

### Comparizon of the Total Profits Generated by the Top-5 States in the US  to the Entire Total Profits made from the US (Bike products only)
```python
# The  Total Profits Generated by the Top-5 States

total_profit_of_top_5_states = top_5_most_profitable_states["Profit"].sum()

total_profit_of_top_5_states
```
```python
# Entire Total Profits made from the US (Bike products only)

total_profit_of_entire_states = bikes_data_usa["Profit"].sum()
total_profit_of_entire_states
```
```python
# calculating the percentage
percent = (total_profit_of_top_5_states / total_profit_of_entire_states) * 100

percent = percent.round(2)

percent
```

print(f"The Total Profits Generated by the Top-5 States, accounts for (percent)% of the company's total profit for USA bikes product") 

The Total Profits Generated by the Top-5 States, accounts for (percent)% of the company's total profit for USA bikes product

### Data Visualization
#  To uncover the Top 5 most profittable states in a pictorial form.

```python
# solution 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

top_5_most_profitable_states.plot(kind = "bar", x = "CustomerState", y = "Profit", color = "blue")

# axis label
plt.xlabel("States")
plt.ylabel("Total Profit in US Dollars")

# title
plt.title("The Top 5 Most Profitable States for Bikes Products in The United States")

# to show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Data Interpretation
The Result from the data visualization above shows that **California**, **Washington**,  **Oregon**, **Florida** and **Wyoming** are the **top-5 states** generating the **highest profits** for **bike products** in the United States.

### Key Findings
---

* The analysis of bike product sales across the United States revealed that **California**, **Washington**, and **Oregon** are the top three states generating the highest profits by a significant margin.

* The top 5 most profitable states and their respective profit figures are as follows:

  | Rank | State      | Total Profit (\$) |
  | ---- | ---------- | ----------------- |
  | 1    | California | 2,247,278.04      |
  | 2    | Washington | 963,999.62        |
  | 3    | Oregon     | 457,411.67        |
  | 4    | Florida    | 3,206.34          |
  | 5    | Wyoming    | 2,868.76          |

* **California alone accounts for over \$2.2 million in profit**, contributes nearly half of the total profit from bike sales nationwide. Indicating a highly dominant market share.


* **Powerful Insight:** The combined total profit from these top 5 states accounts for **99.76% of the total profit** generated across all U.S. states for the bike product category.


* This reveals a **significant concentration of profitability**, with the remaining states contributing less than 0.24% of total profit.

* There is a **sharp drop in profit margins** between Oregon (3rd) and Florida (4th), suggesting a disparity in market performance between the top three states and the rest.

---

### Conclusions
---

* The U.S. market for the bike product is **heavily skewed**, with profitability overwhelmingly concentrated in just only five states accounting for **99.76% of the total profit** generated across all U.S. states for the bike product category.

  
* The remaining states exhibit **minimal or negligible sales impact**, indicating either very low market demand, lack of awareness, or distribution inefficiencies.


* The business is currently **over-reliant on a small subset of regions**, making it vulnerable to regional economic fluctuations or policy changes affecting those states.


* The profitability of bike products is **highly concentrated in the West Coast**, particularly in California, Washington, and Oregon.


* States like Florida and Wyoming, while making the top 5 list, generate **significantly lower profits**, indicating limited market penetration or demand.


* External factors such as **population density, cycling infrastructure, lifestyle preferences, and climate** may be influencing regional demand.

### Recommendation
---

1. **Double Down and Strengthen Sales & Distribution in the Top 5 States**
   Allocate more resources (inventory, marketing budget, local partnerships) and Increase investment in California, Washington, and Oregon—such as to to maintain momentum ,  expand market dominance and defend market share.


2. **Investigate and Conduct Diagnostic Analysis on Low-Performing States**
   Investigate why the remaining  U.S. states contribute less than 1% of total profit. Is it due to poor distribution? Lack of infrastructure? Low demand? Use this to inform turnaround strategies.

3. **Explore Market Diversification**
   To reduce regional dependency, test and pilot tailored campaigns in new promising states with favorable cycling culture, infrastructure, or climate (e.g., Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina).


4. **Scenario Planning & Risk Management**
   Build contingency plans around the top-performing states—since any disruption in these areas could dramatically impact total profitability.

5. **Refine Product Strategy by Region**
   Consider regional customization of product offerings, pricing, or marketing based on the stark difference in performance across states.

6. **Optimize Marketing Strategy**
   Use insights from high-profit regions to craft region-specific campaigns—emphasizing outdoor lifestyle, health, and environmental benefits of biking.

7. **Monitor Trends Over Time**
   Continue to track sales and profitability metrics to identify shifting trends, seasonal patterns, and emerging markets across the country.
